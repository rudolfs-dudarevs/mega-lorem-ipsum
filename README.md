# Mega Lorem Ipsum
*Homework task for a job interview:* <br>
<br>
Create a user data table with CRUD functionality using only vanilla JavaScript and imitate a modern FE framework concept (Vue, React, etc.).

# Get it running

1) `cd server` <br>
2) `npm install` <br>
3) `npm run start-dev` <br>
4) http://localhost:3000/

# Component system
*JavaScriptTemplater* class serves as a mixin to components that provides an abstraction for boilerplate code to create HTML elements. <br>
This allows to create nested DOM structures, pass props and set attributes using JS functions. <br>
Functions prefixed with '$' return a DOM structure.<br>

*Disclaimer:* <br>
*The syntax of DOM structures as functions passed within functions might hurt your eyes. But it works.. Just takes time to adjust.. :)*
